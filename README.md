This repository contains the code used for our USENIX paper <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/publications/2023_USENIX_Confusum.pdf">Confusum Contractum: Confused Deputy Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts</a>.
Our system, `Jackal`, can be used to find exploitable confused deputy vulnerabilities on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Disclaimer 

For different technical and ethical reasons, here we are not releasing a fully automated "push-one-button" solution for the identification and automatic exploitation of smart contracts. Rather, we open-sourced all the necessary scripts to demonstrate the analyses presented in the paper. Interested researchers will have all the necessary code to replicate our work. In case something does not click, please reach out to us :)
