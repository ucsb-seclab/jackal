This repository contains the code used for our USENIX paper <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/publications/2023_USENIX_Confusum.pdf">Confusum Contractum: Confused Deputy Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts</a>.
Our system, `Jackal`, can be used to find exploitable confused deputy vulnerabilities on the Ethereum blockchain.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer 

For different technical and ethical reasons, here we are not releasing a fully automated "push-one-button" solution for the identification and automatic exploitation of smart contracts. Rather, we open-sourced all the necessary scripts to demonstrate the analyses presented in the paper. Interested researchers will have all the necessary code to replicate our work. In case something does not click, please reach out to us :)

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Setup

Just clone the repo and run the `setup.sh` script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucsb-seclab/jackal.git && ./setup.sh <WEB3_RPC_ENDPOINT>
```

This script will install [ethpwn](https://github.com/ethpwn/ethpwn) (the Swiss Army Knife for Smart Contracts Hacking) and [greed](https://github.com/ucsb-seclab/greed), our symbolic execution engine for EVM smart contracts. 

The `WEB3_RPC_ENDPOINT` parameter is a URL to a JSON-RPC Web3 endpoint. If you are running a private node this can be, e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:8545`. Otherwise, you can use services like [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) to obtain access to their API (there is a free-tier which is more than enough for using our tool).



# üöÄ Usage

## `CALL` Inspector

The identification of controllable `CALL`(s) in a smart contract binary is done with the script [run.py](https://github.com/ucsb-seclab/jackal/blob/master/CheckConfusedContracts/run.py) in `CheckConfusedContracts`. e.g.,:

```bash
python run.py --ca 0x204Db9Ca00912c0F9e6380342113f6A0147E6f8C --block 16380000 
```

`0x204Db9Ca00912c0F9e6380342113f6A0147E6f8C` is the address of the contract you want to analyze, while `16380000` is the block (height) that is gonna be used as a reference for this analysis (i.e., storage variables).
If a controllable `CALL` is detected the script will report a True positive by highlighting the log with a green color.
